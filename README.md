## Try it out

This runs a short benchmark to showcase the module live.

```sh
deno run -r --allow-hrtime https://deno.land/x/pretty_benching/example.ts
```

## Getting started

Add the following to your `deps.ts`

```ts
export {
  prettyBenchmarkResult,
  prettyBenchmarkProgress
} from 'https://deno.land/x/pretty_benching@v0.1.2/mod.ts';
```

or just simply import it directly:

```ts
import { prettyBenchmarkResult, prettyBenchmarkProgress } from 'https://deno.land/x/pretty_benching@v0.1.2/mod.ts';
```

## Note

Using Deno's `--allow-hrtime` flag when running your code will result in a more precise benchmarking, because than float milliseconds will be used for measurement instead of integer.

You can use `nocolor` in the options of both `prettyBenchmarkProgress` and `prettyBenchmarkResult` to turn off the coloring on the output.
It doesn't interfere with the Deno's `fmt` color settings.

# prettyBenchmarkProgress

Prints the Deno `runBenchmarks()` method's `progressCb` callback values in a nicely readable format.

### Usage

Simply add it to `runBenchmarks()` like below and you are good to go. Using `silent: true` is encouraged, so the default logs don't interfere

```ts
await runBenchmarks({ silent: true }, prettyBenchmarkProgress())
```

The output would look something like this during running:

![running](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/littletof/prettyBenching/master/docs/imgs/prettyBenchingProgress_example_running.png)

End when finished:

![finished](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/littletof/prettyBenching/master/docs/imgs/prettyBenchingProgress_example_finished.png)

### Thresholds

You can define thresholds to specific benchmarks and than the times of the runs will be colored respectively

```ts
const thresholds = {
  "for100ForIncrementX1e6": {green: 0.85, yellow: 1},
  "for100ForIncrementX1e8": {green: 84, yellow: 93},
  "forIncrementX1e9": {green: 900, yellow: 800},
  "forIncrementX1e9x2": {green: 15000, yellow: 18000},
}

runBenchmarks({ silent: true }, prettyBenchmarkProgress({thresholds}))
```

![threshold](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/littletof/prettyBenching/master/docs/imgs/prettyBenchingProgress_example_threshold.png)

### Indicators

You can use indicators, which help you categorise your benchmarks. You can change the character which gets added before the benchmark. 

```ts
const indicators = [
  { benches: /100/, modFn: colors.bgRed },
  { benches: /for/, modFn: colors.red },
  { benches: /custom/, modFn: () => colors.bgYellow(colors.black("%")) }, // changes indicator char
];
```

![indicator](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/littletof/prettyBenching/master/docs/imgs/prettyBenchingProgress_example_indicators.png)

# prettyBenchmarkResults

Prints the Deno `runBenchmarks()` method's result in a nicely readable format.

### Usage

Simply call `prettyBenchmarkResult` with the desired settings.

Setting the `nocolor` option to `true` will remove all the built in coloring. Its usefull, if you log it somewhere or save the output to a file. It won't interfere with Deno's `fmt` color settings.

Use the `silent: true` flag in `runBenchmarks`, if you dont want to see the default output

```ts
// ...add benches...

runBenchmarks({silent: true})
.then(prettyBenchmarkResult())
.catch((e: any) => {
  console.error(e.stack);
});
```

The output would look something like this:

![example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/littletof/prettyBenching/master/docs/imgs/prettyBenchingResult_example.png)

### Thresholds

You can define thresholds to specific benchmarks and than related things, like times or graph bars will be colored respectively. This can use the same thresholds object as in `prettyBenchmarkProgress`.

```ts
const thresholds = {
      "multiple-runs": { green: 76, yellow: 82 },
      "benchmark-start": { green: 2, yellow: 3 },
};

runBenchmarks().then(prettyBenchmarkResult({ thresholds }));
```

![threshold](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/littletof/prettyBenching/master/docs/imgs/prettyBenchingResult_example_threshold.png)

### Indicators

You can use indicators, which help you categorise your benchmarks besides just their names. You can set what color the table should have. With `modFn` you can also change what color the marker should be, or even change the indicator icon like seen below (default is `#`).
You can pass this object to `prettyBenchmarkProgress` too.

```ts
const indicators = [
  {
    benches: /multiple-runs/,
    tableColor: colors.magenta,
    modFn: () => "ðŸš€",
  }
];

runBenchmarks().then(prettyBenchmarkResult({ indicators }));
```

![indicator](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/littletof/prettyBenching/master/docs/imgs/prettyBenchingResult_example_indicators.png)

### Parts

You can change what the result cards should contain with the `parts` object. Once you define it you have to set all parts you want. The default parts setting is `{ graph: true, graphBars: 5 }`.

You can define what `parts` you want to use in the options, like this:

```ts
prettyBenchmarkResult(
      {
        nocolor: false,
        thresholds,
        indicators,
        parts: {
          extraMetrics: true,
          threshold: true,
          graph: true,
          graphBars: 10,
        },
      },
    )
```

Using all options:

![thresholdLine](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/littletof/prettyBenching/master/docs/imgs/prettyBenchingResult_example_full_extra.png)

##### Extra metrics `{ extraMetrics: true }`

Setting this will give you an extra row, which adds extra calculated values like `min`, `max`, `mean as ((min+max)/2)` , `median`.

![extraMetrics](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/littletof/prettyBenching/master/docs/imgs/prettyBenchingResult_example_extrametrics_line.png)

##### Threshold `{ threshold: true }`

> Need to have `thresholds` in the root which have a matching threshold for the specific benchmark, otherwise it wont add it to the specific card.

It simply show what the set thresholds for the benchmark. Can be usefull if `nocolor` is set to true.

![thresholdLine](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/littletof/prettyBenching/master/docs/imgs/prettyBenchingResult_example_threshold_line.png)

##### Graph `{ graph: true, graphBars: 5 }`

Adds a graph, which shows the distribution of the runs of the benchmark.
> Only shows, when there are `10` or more runs set.

The graph shows the results groupped into timeframes, where the groups frame start from the value on the head of its line, and end with excluding the value on the next line.

With `graphBars` you can set how many bars it should show. Default is `5`.

# prettyBenchmarkDown

Generates a summary markdown from the results of the Deno `runBenchmarks()` method's result.

### Usage

Simply call `prettyBenchmarkDown` with the desired settings.

```ts
// ...add benches...

runBenchmarks()
.then(prettyBenchmarkDown(console.log))
.catch((e: any) => {
  console.error(e.stack);
});
```

The first parameter of this function is an output function, where you cen recieve the generated markdown's text. In the example above it just print is to `console`.

Without defining any options, it will generate one `markdown` table with one row for each benchmark.
Something like this:

> |Name|Runs|Total (ms)|Average (ms)|
> |:--|--:|--:|--:|
> |Sorting arrays|4000|1506.683|0.377|
> |Rotating arrays|1000|1935.981|1.936|
> |Proving NP==P|1|4194.431|4194.431|
> |Standing out|1000|369.566|0.370|

### Options

You can fully customise the generated `markdown`. Add text, use predefined, or custom columns or group your benchmarks and define these per group.

**âš TODO** Here you can seen an example that showcases every option.

#### Extra texts

* `title`: Defines a level 1 title (`# MyTitle`) on the top of the generated markdown
* `description`: Defines a part, that is put before any result tables. If defined as a function, it recieves the `runBenchmarks` result, so it can be set dinamically. It also accepts a simple string as well.
* `afterTables`: Defines a part, that is put after all the result tables. If defined as a function, it recieves the `runBenchmarks` result, so it can be set dinamically. It also accepts a simple string as well.

#### Columns

You can customise, what columns you want to see in each table. To see what every column type generates check out the example **TODO LINK + on every column type**

* If `not defined`, the generator uses the default columns defined by the module
* If `defined`, you take full control, of what columns you want to see. The default columns are exported, and there are other premade columns for you to use.

##### defaultColumns

It includes `Name`, `Runs`, `Total (ms)` and `Average (ms)` columns, these are the default values of the `BenchmarkRunResult`.

##### indicatorColumn(indicators?: BenchIndicator[])

Defines a column, that contains the indicator for the given bench, if defined. Keep in mind, that it strips any color from the indicator.

##### thresholdsColumn(thresholds: Thresholds, indicateResult?: boolean)

Defines a column, that shows the threshold ranges for the given bench, if defined. If you set `indicateResult` to true, it shows in what range the benchmark fell, in the same cell.

##### thresholdResultColumn(thresholds: Thresholds)

Defines a column, that show into what threhold range the benchmark fell.

##### extraMetricsColumns(options?)

Defines columns, that show extra calculated metrics like `min`, `max`, `mean`, `median`, `stdDeviation`. You can define which of these you want, in the options. You can also tell it, to put `-` in the cells, where the benchmark was only run once.

##### Custom columns

When you need something else, you can define you own columns. You can put custom `ColumnDefinitions` into the `columns` array.

* The simplest way, is to give it a `propertyKey`, and than it shows that value of the `BenchmarkResult`. You can use any key here, but you will have to put these values into the results manually. If a `result[propertyKey` is `undefined`, than it puts a `-` into that cell.
If your returned value is a `number`, than you can use `toFixed` to tell what precision you want to see. (It's ignored if value is not a number)

* If your usecase is more complex, than you can use the `formatter` method, where you get the benchmark result, and you can return any value that you want from that. The predefined column types above use this method as well.

```ts
interface ColumnDefinition {
  title: string;
  propertyKey?: string;
  align?: "left" | "center" | "right";
  toFixed?: number;
  formatter?: (result: BenchmarkResult, columnDef: ColumnDefinition) => string;
}
```

#### Groups

You can group your benches, so they are separated in your generated markdown. For this, you need to define `include` RegExp. Right now, every benchmark, that doesnt fit any group will be put into one table at the bottom, so if you dont want some filter them before manually.

In each group you can define a `name` which will be a level 2 heading (`## Name`) before you group.

You can also define `description` and `afterTable`, which behave the same like the ones in the root of options.

If you want, you can have different columns in each group, if you define them in the groups `columns` array.
  
### As github action

Use this as a github action, eg. comment benchmark results on PRs.

You can see an example Github Action for this here, and see the generated comments here.
