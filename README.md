# prettyBenching
A simple Deno library, that gives you pretty benchmarking progress and results in the commandline

**âš  Appeareance is likely to change until v1.0.0 of this lib âš **

[![deno version](https://img.shields.io/badge/ROADMAP-5e5e5e?logo=discover)](#roadmap)

## Getting started
Add the following to your `deps.ts`
```ts 
export {
  prettyBenchmarkResult,
  prettyBenchmarkProgress
} from 'https://deno.land/x/pretty_benching@v0.1.0/mod.ts';
```

or just simply
```ts
import { prettyBenchmarkResult, prettyBenchmarkProgress } from 'https://deno.land/x/pretty_benching@v0.1.0/mod.ts';
```

## Note

Using Deno's `--allow-hrtime` flag when running your code will result in a more precise benchmarking, because than float milliseconds will be used for measurement instead of integer.

You can use `nocolor` in the options of both `prettyBenchmarkProgress` and `prettyBenchmarkResult` to turn off the coloring on the output.
It doesn't interfere with the Deno's `fmt` color settings.

# prettyBenchmarkProgress

Prints the Deno `runBenchmarks()` methods `progressCb` callback values in a nicely readable format.

### Usage

Simply add it to `runBenchmarks()` like below and you are good to go. Using `silent: true` is encouraged, so the default logs don't interfere

```ts
await runBenchmarks({ silent: true }, prettyBenchmarkProgress())
```

The output would look something like this during running:
![running](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/littletof/prettyBenching/master/docs/imgs/prettyBenchingProgress_example_running.png)

End when finished:
![finished](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/littletof/prettyBenching/master/docs/imgs/prettyBenchingProgress_example_finished.png)

### Thresholds

You can define thresholds to specific benchmarks and than the times of the runs will be colored respectively

```ts
const thresholds = {
  "for100ForIncrementX1e6": {green: 0.85, yellow: 1},
  "for100ForIncrementX1e8": {green: 84, yellow: 93},
  "forIncrementX1e9": {green: 900, yellow: 800},
  "forIncrementX1e9x2": {green: 15000, yellow: 18000},
}

runBenchmarks({ silent: true }, prettyBenchmarkProgress({thresholds}))
```

### Indicators

You can use indicators, which help you categorise your benchmarks. You can change the character which gets added before the benchmark. 

```ts
const indicators = [
  { benches: /100/, modFn: colors.bgRed },
  { benches: /for/, modFn: colors.red },
  { benches: /custom/, modFn: () => colors.bgYellow(colors.black("%")) }, // change "icon"
];
```
![indicator](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/littletof/prettyBenching/master/docs/imgs/prettyBenchingProgress_example_indicators.png)


# prettyBenchmarkResults

Prints the Deno `runBenchmarks()` methods result in a nicely readable format.

### Usage

Simply call `prettyBenchmarkResult` with the desired settings.

Setting the `nocolor` option to `true` will remove all the built in coloring. Its usefull, if you log it somewhere or save the output to a file. It won't interfere with Deno's `fmt` color settings.

Use the `silent: true` flag in `runBenchmarks`, if you dont want to see the default output

```ts
// ...add benches...

runBenchmarks({silent: true})
.then(prettyBenchmarkResult())
.catch((e: any) => {
  console.error(e.stack);
});
```

The output would look something like this:
![example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/littletof/prettyBenching/master/docs/imgs/prettyBenchingResult_example.png)

### Thresholds

You can define thresholds to specific benchmarks and than related things, like times or graph bars will be colored respectively. This can use the same thresholds object as in `prettyBenchmarkProgress`.

```ts
const thresholds = {
      "multiple-runs": { green: 76, yellow: 82 },
      "benchmark-start": { green: 2, yellow: 3 },
};

runBenchmarks().then(prettyBenchmarkResult({ thresholds }));
```

![threshold](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/littletof/prettyBenching/master/docs/imgs/prettyBenchingResult_example_threshold.png)

### Indicators

You can use indicators, which help you categorise your benchmarks besides just their names. You can set what color the table should have. With `modFn` you can also change what color the marker should be, or even change the indicator icon like seen below (default is `#`).
You can pass this object to `prettyBenchmarkProgress` too.

```ts
const indicators = [
  {
    benches: /multiple-runs/,
    tableColor: colors.magenta,
    modFn: (str) => "ðŸš€",
  }
];

runBenchmarks().then(prettyBenchmarkResult({ indicators }));
```

### Parts

You can change what the result cards should contain with the `parts` object. Once you define it you have to set all parts you want. The default parts setting is `{ graph: true, graphBars: 5 }`.

You can define what `parts` you want to use in the options, like this:

```ts
prettyBenchmarkResult(
      {
        nocolor: false,
        thresholds,
        indicators,
        parts: {
          extraMetrics: true,
          threshold: true,
          graph: true,
          graphBars: 10,
        },
      },
    )
```

Using all options:

![thresholdLine](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/littletof/prettyBenching/master/docs/imgs/prettyBenchingResult_example_full_extra.png)

##### Extra metrics `{ extraMetrics: true }`

Setting this will give you an extra row, which adds extra calculated values like `min`, `max`, `mean as ((min+max)/2)` , `median`.

![extraMetrics](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/littletof/prettyBenching/master/docs/imgs/prettyBenchingResult_example_extrametrics_line.png)

##### Threshold `{ threshold: true }`

> Need to have `thresholds` in the root which have a matching threshold for the specific benchmark, otherwise it wont add it to the specific card.

It simply show what the set thresholds for the benchmark. Can be usefull if `nocolor` is set to true.

![thresholdLine](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/littletof/prettyBenching/master/docs/imgs/prettyBenchingResult_example_threshold_line.png)

##### Graph `{ graph: true, graphBars: 5 }`

Adds a graph, which shows the distribution of the runs of the benchmark.
> Only shows, when there are `10` or more runs set.

The graph shows the results groupped into timeframes, where the groups frame start from the value on the head of its line, and end with excluding the value on the next line.

With `graphBars` you can set how many bars it should show. Default is `5`.

# Roadmap

#### BenchmarkProgress
- [x] Add `indicator` options
- [x] Add `nocolor` option
- [ ] Add overridable output function like in benchmark results

#### BenchmarkResults
- [x] Overrideable output function
- [x] Refactor outputting result in a single call
- [x] Add `nocolor` option
- [x] Fix graph
- [x] Add `indicator` options like in progress
- [x] Tidy up current benchmark results look
- [x] Add options to define what parts are shown in the result cards. (eg. show graph, more calculated values like mean, ...)
- [ ] Find a place in `extraMetrics` for `standard deviation`.
- [ ] Add option to crop outlayer results from graph (maybe with a percent limit).
- [ ] Add an option to have a minimalist result output, that resembles the final progress output, instead of the big cards.
  
#### Historic data
- [ ] Add module to enable historic data save/read inside repo
- [ ] Make use of historic module, enable automatic calculating of thresholds from previous runs
- [ ] Option to use historic data, to tell if benchmarks got better or worse from previous runs.

#### Operational
- [x] Write README docs
- [x] Separate `prettyBenchmarkResults` and `prettyBenchmarkProgress` into independently importable modules.
- [x] Add the ability to follow the change on how the outputs look like.
- [ ] Refactor how optional `options` are handled
- [ ] Proper tests
- [ ] Write JSDocs
- [ ] Refactor README
- [ ] Add showcase module, which helps to have consistent docs images
- [ ] Make module contributor friendly
